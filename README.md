# Siddharth Mistry portfolio

This repository hosts my online portfolio. To visit the website simply go to: https://mistry-siddharth.github.io/

To see the working code:
- Clone or download the repository
- Open index.html in any text editor (example Sublime Text 3)
- To see the CSS implemented go to folder css/style.css and open it in any text editor (example Sublime Text 3)

index.html houses the html code that defines the basic structure of the website. Twitter's Bootstrap was used for basic styling of the page. Following modules were downloaded from Bootstrap to implement several functionalities:
- Common CSS
  - Typography
  - Grid system
  - Forms
  - Buttons
  - Responsive Utilities
- Components
  - Navs
  - Navbar
 - JavaScript components
  - Component animations
  - Modal
  
On top this style.css contains other styling to overwrite some of Bootstrap's default styling and implementing other functions. Minified version of style.css is used in actual implementation to improve performance of the website.

index.html also houses JavaScript for implementing functions like smooth scrolling to an anchor element on the same page and return to top.

Formspree service is used to implement form functionality to forward messages to my email account.

Font Awesome is used for displaying icons for LinkedIn, GitHub and email envelope.

Favicon was used for generating website icon.
